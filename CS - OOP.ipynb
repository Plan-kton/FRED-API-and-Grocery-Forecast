This cheat sheet covers the **fundamentals of OOP in Python**.\n","\n","---\n","## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining a Class and Creating Objects**\n","**Definition:** A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. An **object** is an instance of a class.\n","```python\n","# Define a class\n","class Car:\n","    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n","        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n","        self.model = model  # Attribute\n","        self.year = year    # Attribute\n","\n","    def display_info(self):\n","        return f\"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}\"\n","\n","# Create an object (instance)\n","my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n","print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: 2022 Toyota Corolla\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Class Attributes vs. Instance Attributes**\n","**Definition:** A **class attribute** is shared across all instances of a class, while an **instance attribute** is unique to each object.\n","```python\n","class Dog:\n","    species = \"Canis familiaris\"  # Class attribute (shared by all instances)\n","\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name  # Instance attribute\n","        self.age = age    # Instance attribute\n","\n","# Accessing attributes\n","dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n","dog2 = Dog(\"Charlie\", 5)\n","print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris\n","print(dog2.name)     # Output: Charlie\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Instance Methods, Class Methods, and Static Methods**\n","**Definition:**\n","- **Instance methods** work on specific objects of a class.\n","- **Class methods** affect the class as a whole.\n","- **Static methods** are independent of instance or class attributes.\n","```python\n","class Circle:\n","    pi = 3.14159  # Class attribute\n","\n","    def __init__(self, radius):\n","        self.radius = radius  # Instance attribute\n","\n","    def area(self):  # Instance method\n","        return self.pi * (self.radius ** 2)\n","\n","    @classmethod  # Class method\n","    def set_pi(cls, new_pi):\n","        cls.pi = new_pi\n","\n","    @staticmethod  # Static method\n","    def info():\n","        return \"This is a Circle class.\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance (Parent & Child Classes)**\n","**Definition:** Inheritance allows a class (child) to derive properties and behaviors from another class (parent).\n","```python\n","class Animal:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","\n","    def speak(self):\n","        return \"This animal makes a sound.\"\n","\n","# Child class (inherits from Animal)\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        return \"Woof!\"\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        return \"Meow!\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Method Overriding**\n","**Definition:** Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n","```python\n","class Vehicle:\n","    def start(self):\n","        return \"Starting the vehicle.\"\n","\n","class Car(Vehicle):\n","    def start(self):  # Overrides the parent method\n","        return \"Starting the car engine.\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **6Ô∏è‚É£ The `super()` Function**\n","**Definition:** `super()` allows access to methods from a parent class inside a child class.\n","```python\n","class Parent:\n","    def show(self):\n","        return \"This is the parent class.\"\n","\n","class Child(Parent):\n","    def show(self):\n","        return super().show() + \" And this is the child class.\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation (Public, Protected, Private Attributes)**\n","**Definition:** Encapsulation restricts direct access to some attributes, enforcing controlled access.\n","```python\n","class Person:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name        # Public\n","        self._protected = age   # Protected (convention, not enforced)\n","        self.__private = \"Secret\"  # Private (name mangled)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Magic (Dunder) Methods**\n","**Definition:** Magic methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.) allow objects to interact with Python‚Äôs built-in operations.\n","```python\n","class Book:\n","    def __init__(self, title, author):\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.author = author\n","\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        return f\"{self.title} by {self.author}\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Composition (Has-a Relationship)**\n","**Definition:** Composition is when a class contains another class as an attribute rather than inheriting from it.\n","```python\n","class Engine:\n","    def start(self):\n","        return \"Engine started.\"\n","\n","class Car:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.engine = Engine()  #
